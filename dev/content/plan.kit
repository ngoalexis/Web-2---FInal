          <p>
            For just $8 each plus the cost of pottery, two or more people can paint from 6-10pm on Saturday nights. Bring a date to paint- any date will do- a friend, family member, spouse, or significant other. It's "adult paint time" which means we will never have a kid's party going on after 6:30pm so relax, unwind and bring some wine. Sorry, no food is allowed at this time while the state public mask rules are in effect for retail establishments.
